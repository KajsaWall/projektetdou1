              <p>Hot Pink is the second studio album by American singer and rapper Doja Cat. It was released on November 7, 2019, by Kemosabe and RCA Records. A departure from the sound of her debut album Amala (2018), Hot Pink is a pop and R&B record containing elements of funk, hip hop and soul. It was written by Doja Cat alongside other songwriters and producers, with production from Yeti Beats and Tyson Trax. Guest vocals are contributed by Smino, Gucci Mane, and Tyga. Doja Cat's real name is Amalaratna "Amala" Zandile Dlamini. She chose the stage name Doja Cat because of her love for marijuana (doja is another name for weed, btw) and… cats. </p>

              <p>Planet Her is the third studio album by American rapper and singer Doja Cat. It was released on June 25, 2021, by Kemosabe and RCA Records. The album, titled after a fictional planet created by Doja Cat, sees her experimenting with sounds that were new and unfamiliar to her before, in an attempt to depart from mainstream music trends. She likened the shift in her musical style to travelling outside the Earth and into outer space. The album features guest appearances from Young Thug, Ariana Grande, The Weeknd, JID, and SZA, with Eve and Gunna featuring on the deluxe version.</p>
